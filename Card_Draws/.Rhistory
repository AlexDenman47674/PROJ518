#While in an actual game of poker other hands can be made that relate to the card value not just the suit for the sake of this test only the suit will be taken into account
#In addition as this test compares successive groups of 5 cards and each deck contains 52 cards, cards 51 and 52 will be noted and excluded from testing
#The suit of these cards will be taken into consideration and the probability of the respective suits will be adjusted accordingly
